     *
     * This method takes the name of a view file (using dot notation for directories)
     * and an optional array of data to be extracted and made available within the view
     * and layout files. It handles locating the view and layout files, extracting data,
     * capturing the view's output, and including it within the layout.
     * It also attempts to determine the current request path to make it available to the view.
     *
     * @param string $view The name of the view file to render (e.g., 'pages.index', 'admin.users.show').
     *                     Uses dot notation relative to the `app/Views/` directory.
     * @param array $data An associative array of data to extract into variables for the view and layout.
     *                    Keys become variable names (e.g., ['title' => 'My Page'] makes $title available).
     * @return void This method outputs the rendered HTML directly and does not return a value.
     *              It terminates execution with an error message if view or layout files are missing
     *              or if there's an error during view rendering.
